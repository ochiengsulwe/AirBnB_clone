# The first full web application: the AirBnB clone
   # Description üìÑ
This is the first phase of a four phase project, to create a basic clone of the AirBnB web app. In this first phase a basic console was created using the Cmd Python module, to manage the objects of the whole project, being able to implement the methods create a new object, retrieve an object, do operations on objects, update atrributes of an object, and destroy an object.

The AirBnB Clone Console is the first part of the AirBnB project. The final product of the AirBnB project will be look-alike of the AirBnB website with some similar functionality. In this segment, a command line interprater is created to manage objects for the AirBnB-Clone project.

    The console is supposed to perform the following:
        1. Create a new Object(...user, place, etc.)
        2. Retrieve an object from a file eg. a database
        3. Update an object and it's attributes
        4. Perform operations on objects(...count objects, etc)
        5. Destroy an object
